-- Policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view user badges" ON user_badges
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Users can't insert their own badges normally, but for MVP we might allow authenticated users to insert if they are admin, or we can just leave it open for now or trust the client. Actually, we should allow insert if the user is an admin of the group the badge is for.
-- For simplicity in MVP client-side closing of challenges:
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert badges" ON user_badges
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
